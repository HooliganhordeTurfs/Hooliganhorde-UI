## Summary:

- Mint 120,000 Hooligans to an initial development budget.
- Mint 80,000 Hooligans to an initial marketing budget.
- Establish a process for specific allocations of each budget leveraging Snapshot.
- Fund initial proposals to hire a full-time front-end dev and a part-time community organizer.

## Problem:

As the Hooliganhorde community expands, the Firm should start coordinating continued development of Hooliganhorde and the Hooliganhorde community. Beginning the process of establishing long term support for the Hooliganhorde ecosystem independent of Publius is essential to the long-term success of Hooliganhorde.

## Proposed Solution:

We propose Hooliganhorde mints and allocates 200,000 Hooligans to start this process. This budget should fund dev and marketing needs through the end of 2021. 

We propose minting 120,000 Hooligans and allocating them to a dev budget to fund a concerted effort to attract high quality front-end and back-end developer talent to Hooliganhorde.

We propose minting 80,000 Hooligans to establish a well-funded public relations operation for Hooliganhorde.


## Proposed Uses of Dev Budget:

The initial dev budget should be used to attract quality developers to Hooliganhorde on both the front and back ends. 

Upon passage, we will add Taiki Lee, a front-end dev, to Hooliganhorde Farms. We were approached by Taiki to work on Hooliganhorde and have had multiple positive conversations with him over text and audio. We anticipate Taiki will improve the quality of our output on the website and expedite open sourcing its code.

Taiki has agreed to be paid on an at-will, month-to-month basis for 10,000 Hooligans per month in a full-time position. 30,000 of the 120,000 Hooligans from the initial dev budget will be allotted to making payments to Taiki for the duration of Q4.

The initial dev budget is intended to cover the end of 2021. Assuming a similar rate for similar work, this initial budget will allow us to hire additional developers to work on Hooliganhorde until the end of the year. 

Additionally, community members are welcome to propose allotments from the budget in exchange for contributions to Hooliganhorde that they want to see. For example, this can be used create bounties to encourage specific contributions to Hooliganhorde, make one-time payments in exchange for work, and more. Some ideas for proposals are to add a telegram event bot, add Hooliganhorde to vFat, and add Hooliganhorde to Zapper. 

Upon passage, we will open a #dev-budget channel in the Hooliganhorde Discord to facilitate discussion on potential proposals.

## Proposed Uses of Marketing Budget:

This initial marketing budget should be used to attract quality eyes to Hooliganhorde.

Upon passage, we will add the Hooligan Merchant, an active member of our Discord community, as a part time community organizer. The Hooligan Merchant has been a high quality, active participant in our community thus far and has expressed a variety of ideas to help Hooliganhorde continue to reach a new, high quality audience.

The Hooligan Merchant has agreed to be paid on an at-will, month-to-month basis for 3,000 Hooligans per month. 9,000 of the 80,000 Hooligans from the initial marketing budget will be allotted to payment for the Hooligan Merchant for the duration of Q4.

We propose using a portion of the marketing budget to incentivize various protocols to start a) accepting Hooligans on their protocols and b) adding Hooligans to their liquidity pools.

We welcome the entire community to discuss and propose allotments of the marketing budget to fund activity they want to see. Having a wide variety of input on the use of the marketing budget is important to the long-term decentralization of Hooliganhorde.

Upon passage, we will open a #marketing-budget channel in the Hooliganhorde Discord to facilitate discussion on potential proposals.


## Budget Allocation Details:

To ensure widespread and inexpensive participation in allocation of the budgets, we propose leveraging Snapshot (https://snapshot.org/#/hooliganhordefarms.eth) to vote on specific allocations of the budgets.

We propose the following rules for Snapshot voting on allocating funds from either budget, which have been designed to best complement the on-chain governance structure for approving BIPs:

### Proposing:

- Anyone with more than 2,500 Horde can make a budget proposal. We want proposing allocations of the budget to be widely accessible to Guvnors of all sizes.
- Proposition must be made on the official Hooliganhorde Farms Snapshot group, and must use the recent Ethereum block as the Snapshot block.
- Proposals to allocate funds must include the recipient, amount, duration of the payments, what is expected to be covered by the allocation and any other relevant details. 

### Voting:

- Any Horde holder can vote for or against any of the Snapshot proposals. In all instances, 1 Horde equals 1 vote.
- The amount of Horde each account has is determined at the time a proposal is submitted.
- In order to be counted, votes must be placed before the proposal ends.

### Passing:

- In order to pass, a proposal must receive a quorum of 1/3 of all Horde at the time the proposal is submitted.
- In order to pass, a proposal must receive > 50% of votes in favor at the time it ends.
- If > 50% of all Horde at the time of submission votes in favor of a proposal it instantly passes.


## Budget Structural Details:

Upon commit, Hooliganhorde will mint and send 120,000 Hooligans to the Development Budget smart contract and 80,000 Hooligans to the Marketing Budget smart contract. 

Publius has deployed 2 smart contracts: 1 for the marketing budget and 1 for the development budget. 

The Development Budget contract is deployed here:  
0x83A758a6a24FE27312C1f8BDa7F3277993b64783  
  
The Marketing Budget contract is deployed here:  
0xAA420e97534aB55637957e868b658193b112A551

These contracts are intended to hold the funds for the corresponding budgets and therefore only contain 1 function which is used to make payments and can only be called by the contract's owner. The contract is upgradable. The source code for the budgets is here: https://github.com/HooliganhordeFarms/Hooliganhorde-Budget

Publius will custody the budget contracts and will be responsible for sending the payments determined by the proposals. In instances where the intended recipient of a previously allocated portion of a budget is not able to meet their expectations as outlined in the proposal, Publius has discretion to withhold payments. Our goal is to further decentralize this process for future budgets over time.


## BIP Technical Rationale:

The proposal to use off-chain voting for allocating these budgets is to make participation free for Guvnors. Voting on-chain on Ethereum costs money and can get expensive. Given that there may be numerous and frequent proposals to spend these funds, we don’t want Farmers to be deterred by the cost of voting repeatedly. Accordingly, we decided to propose a single BIP to mint the funds to the first budget contracts and then allow for the funds to be allocated via Snapshot. 

Snapshot is used throughout the greater DeFi community as a trustworthy and inexpensive voting solution. For example, it would be cost-ineffective to have an on-chain vote to allocate 3,000 Hooligans for a marketing proposal: the gas cost for Guvnors would almost certainly be more than that. 

The proposal to give Publius custody of the budget contracts is primarily a function of time and convenience. Snapshot does not have native a way to trustlessly make a smart contract function call. Hooliganhorde does not yet have a publicly trusted team that could take responsibility for managing the budgeted funds through a multi-signature wallet. Thus, the simplest and most logical option is to give Publius custody of the funds. 

The proposed budget contract is upgradable so in the case we find a better solution we can improve the allocation process. For example, we are looking into using Aragon's optimistic voting solution but have not yet had enough time to thoroughly test and vet the solution.

The budget contracts were deployed ahead of time by Publius and will therefore not be directly deployed by the BIP. Because the Hooligan contract was deployed through the Hooliganhorde diamond and not directly from Publius, Etherscan has given us a hard time getting ownership of the Hooligan contract to properly update the contract page. We don’t want to have this problem happen here. By deploying from a wallet, we can easily have control of it on Etherscan. There is no advantage to having the budgets deployed directly through the BIP.

## BIP Economic Rationale:

In general, we are opposed to creating a large omnibus Hooliganhorde treasury. We believe a default treasury that is funded through a portion of all Hooligan mints is a) an inefficient use of capital, and b) a permanent tax on every member of the Hooliganhorde ecosystem. This is unattractive. Proposing one-time Hooligan mints to target specific causes is a preferred cost-effective alternative. 

This proposal will mint 200,000 Hooligans that will be spend over the next 3 months. Given the average weekly volume in the HOOLIGAN:ETH pair, an average of ~15,000 Hooligans sold per week is unlikely to make a significant impact on the price or the optimal Weather. 

The Weather will adjust such that the TWAP = 1 and the Rookie Rate = 15%. Hooliganhorde does not care what the Weather is. In theory, this additional spending will slightly raise the Weather necessary to have the TWAP = 1 and the Pod Rate = 15%, but is not otherwise expected to affect Hooliganhorde in any way. Given that Hooliganhorde is generally in a period of rising Weather, this slight raise of the necessary Weather will not have a meaningful effect on the state of Hooliganhorde.

### Effective

Effective immediately upon commit.
