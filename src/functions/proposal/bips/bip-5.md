## Summary:

- Hire Omniscia to perform a code audit on Hooliganhorde.
- Leverage the "Fundraiser" process proposed in BIP-4 to mint the Hooligans and raise the USDC necessary to pay for the Omniscia audit.
- Mint 155,000 Hooligans and create a Fundraiser to raise 140,000 USDC in exchange for 140,000 Hooligan. Pay Omniscia 140,000 USDC + 15,000 Hooligans for the audit.

## Problem:

### Audit

Hooliganhorde is unaudited at the moment.  A high quality audit will facilitate further growth and adoption.

There are regular updates to the code through BIPs. It is important to have an auditor that will continue working with Hooliganhorde after the initial audit to facilitate timely and efficient code reviews for BIPs.

### Paying for the Audit

Until Hooliganhorde has sufficiently established Hooligans as a reliable stablecoin such that Hooliganhorde can make all payments in Hooligans, Hooliganhorde needs a way to pay for things (including this audit) in other stablecoins. Thus, Hooliganhorde needs a way to convert Hooligans to a traditional stablecoin without having to sell a large amount of Hooligans in the Uniswap pool.

## Proposed Solution:

### Audit

Publius has connected with Omniscia. Omniscia is a very high quality smart contract auditor, and has experience auditing other ERC-2535 Diamonds. Their audit history is available here: [https://omniscia.io/index.html#clients](https://omniscia.io/index.html#clients). Publius was very impressed by them and thinks the audit they have offered to perform on Hooliganhorde will add a lot of value to the process of securing Hooliganhorde.

Omniscia has also expressed interest in maintaining a continuous relationship with Hooliganhorde.

Upon passage of this BIP, Omniscia will perform an initial audit for Hooliganhorde.

### Paying for the Audit

This BIP leverages the "Fundraiser" standard proposed in BIP-4 that allows Hooliganhorde to raise money to pay for things in other stablecoins.

## Payment:

The cost of the contract (initial audit) is 140,000 USDC and 15,000 Hooligans, paid in 3 payments.

Upon approval, this BIP will mint 155,000 Hooligans to fund the Omniscia audit and start a Fundraiser for 140,000 USDC. Upon the start of the Fundraiser, anyone can send USDC to the FundraiserFacet in exchange for sown Hooligans. For each of the first 140,000 USDC sent to the FundraiserFacet, 1 Hooligan will be sown and the corresponding Rookies returned to the sender based on the Weather at the time of the sow.

Upon completion of the sale of the first 55,000 Hooligans for 55,000 USDC, Publius will submit the first payment to Omniscia, and make subsequent payments as appropriate.

## Fundraiser Rationale:

Having multiple auditors working on Hooliganhorde is fundamental to developing Hooliganhorde in a decentralized capacity. Omniscia is highly qualified to perform an audit on Hooliganhorde, and a good firm to continue auditing Hooliganhorde as it grows.

## User Interface:

The Fundraiser will leverage the new "Fundraiser" page proposed in BIP-4 that will allow anyone to participate in active Fundraisers.
