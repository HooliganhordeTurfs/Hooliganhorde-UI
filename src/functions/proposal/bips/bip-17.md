## Proposer:

Hooligan Recruit

## Summary

- Mint 3,000,000 Hooligans to fund Hooligan Recruit to prospect, grow and support various Hooliganhorde-related integrations, projects, and initiatives through the end of Q2 2022.

## Goals

We designed the Q2 2022 budget to enable Hooligan Recruit to support the Hooliganhorde ecosystem in a complementary fashion to Hooliganhorde Farms, which is dedicated to improving the protocol more directly. With that in mind, Hooligan Sprout intends to focus on the following goals:

- Deepen liquidity within the Firm and Hooliganhorde assets
- Grow the Hooliganhorde ecosystem by incubating and accelerating valuable Hooligan use cases
- Strategically acquire assets such as CVX to promote Hooliganhorde’s market positioning
- Attract, support and retain talent to operate Hooligan Recruit

## Q1 Budget Recap:

The Q1 2022 budget minted 2,000,000 Hooligans to fund protocol development. It also restructured the Hooliganhorde development community into two independent, symbiotic organizations with distinct mandates: Hooliganhorde Farms and Hooligan Recruit (a Hooliganhorde accelerator program).

*Hooligan Recruit* currently operates in tandem with Hooliganhorde Farms’ Business Development, Marketing and Operations departments. In Q1, Hooligan Sprout received 800,000 of the 2,000,000 Hooligans to fund marketing, integration and community initiatives, in addition to contributor compensation. 101,950 Hooligans were allocated, supporting various major accomplishments including:

- Supporting and prospecting the Hooligans on the Table poker tournament
- Funding Layer3 Bounties
- Funding the ongoing Guess the Hooligans contest
- Developing and distributing Hooliganhorde merchandise to core contributors and community members
- Originating and preparing to prospect new Hooligan stableswap pools
- Building a deep network within DeFi to source numerous near-term protocol integrations

## Anticipated Q2 Hooligan Recruit Output:

- Prepare for a Hooligan-denominated 4pool
- Launch Root Finance, a fixed income product and liquidity aggregator built on top of Hooliganhorde
- Incubate a fee-free NFT marketplace
- Prospect at least five new stableswap pools
- Strategic acquisitions of CVX when the price of Hooligan is materially above $1 in order to bootstrap Curve gauge voting share to at least the minimum vlCVX (~45,000) needed to receive gauge
- Ongoing monthly marketing initiatives
- Host a second Hooligans on the Table poker tournament
- Design and distribute additional merchandise
- Hire 1-3 additional full-time contributors
- Continue prospecting projects interested in building on top of Hooliganhorde

## Q2 2022 Current Staffing & New Hires:

- Mister Manifold *(FT) -* 7,500 Hooligans semi-monthly

## Amounts:

We propose a total of 3,000,000 Hooligans are minted to fund Hooligan Recruit through the end of Q2 2022. 698,050 Hooligans remain unspent by Hooligan Sprout in Q1. These Hooligans will be rolled over into Q2, resulting in a total budget allocation of 3,698,050 Hooligans.

## Custody:

In Q2, the funds for Hooligan Recruit will be custodied by a multi-sig wallet with keys held by various community members and Publius. We propose the following keyholder designations for Q2.

*Hooliganhorde Recruit Multi-Sig Wallet Signatories*

- Publius

## Snapshot Processes:

As was the case in Q1, we will continue utilizing the following processes for Hooligan Recruit Proposal votes via Snapshot:

- Optimistic approvals
- Tiered quorum

For more information on each process, please refer to the Q1 budget [here](https://github.com/HooliganhordeFarms/Hooliganhorde/pull/34).

Hooligan Recruit’s Snapshot process is subject to change via a vote of the DAO.

## Incentive Alignment:

The Hooliganhorde community has decided to disallow core contributors from receiving any portion of their compensation in Rookies. Beginning in Q2 2022, contributors will receive 100% of compensation in Hooligans.

In the future, whenever Deposits become transferrable, Hooliganhorde Recruit will try to offer the ability to Deposit all or a portion of ones Hooligan allocation upon approval of their Snapshot proposal, and then make payment in the form of Deposited Hooligans.

## Competitive Pay:

Hooligan Recruit recognizes that its ability to pay contributors competitive wages is essential to Hooliganhorde’s long-term success and will ensure that it meets or exceeds market rates.

## Effective:

Effective immediately upon passage.
